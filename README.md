# Block-Chain
This project is on Block chain concept which I have pitched in Deloitte Digital &amp; Blockchain Lab Dublin.
In the blockchain lab Dublin, we have given the challenge to come up with the idea where we can improve the money transfer system 
using blockchain concepts. Also, we are the team of 6 energetic and jovial team member of UCD decided to find the current 
problems we face in the money transfer overseas so we came up with the real problem like the long processing time, middle man's charges, 
not easy to track and fluctuating conversion rate over the transaction from one country to another.
Currently, when transaction initiated by one country's bank it goes through the middle man which increase the transaction time and 
put unnecessary charges. So we portrayed this problem in a role play where a student in Ireland needs an urgent help but due to a 
long process of the transaction, he got into the big trouble as ran out of money. So, we thought about the new cutting edge technology 
called blockchain which is very efficient in dealing with the problem we have come across. As the block chain is a decentralized, 
distributed ledger provides a way for sharing, maintaining and recording the information by a community. So, We proposed a new idea 
called closed bank coin network based on the block chain which gives the facility to get the transaction done very instantly and 
charges of middleman will be removed. It provides a direct bank-customer network where sender's bank sends the money directly to the 
customer without involving the middleman. In this process, sender's Bank, convert the amount into the bank coin and sell them to 
receiver's bank. It happens over the internet where both banks can bid the bank coins. These bank coin may seem like cryptocurrency 
but it is completely bank regulated and closed to banks only. It's a new medium of trading between banks for transferring the money. 
The receiver will get the same amount of money what been committed at the sender end without getting affected by the interbank coins deal.
